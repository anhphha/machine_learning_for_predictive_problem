# machine_learning_for_predictive_problems

This is about different projects of machine learning to solve predictive problems. Projects were assigned and instructed by Arcada University of Applied Sciences.

The project works include:
- Supervised Learning 
- Unsupervised learning
- Model Evaluation and Improvement: Gridsearch algorithm chains and pipelines
- Representing data engineering features and working with text data
- Deeplearning for Computer Vision
- Stategies for cleaning and managing data
